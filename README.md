# LogisticRegression-TitanicDataset-MachineLearning
In this logistic regression project using the Titanic dataset, we aim to predict the probability of survival for passengers based on various features such as age, gender, and ticket class. This binary classification model helps us understand the factors influencing survival on the ill-fated Titanic.

Titanic dataset is one of the datasets available in sklearn.

We are given:
1. A Training dataset csv file with X train and Y train data
2. A X test File and you have to predict and submit predictions for this file.

Our task is to:
1. Use Logistic Regression and come with predictions.
